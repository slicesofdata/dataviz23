**This homework is due on Mar. 7, 2023 at 11:00pm. Please submit as a pdf file on Canvas.**

**Problem 1:  (6 pts)** We will work with the dataset `olympics_2002` that contains the count of all athletes by sex for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. It has been derived from the `olympics` dataset, which is described here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/readme.md

```{r}
olympics_2002
```
Follow these steps and display the modified dataframe after each step:

1. Rearrange the dataframe into long form. The resulting dataframe will have two columns, which you should call `sex` and `count`. There will be two rows of data, one for female and one for male athletes.
2. Create a new column with the percent for each `sex`
3. Rename the values in `sex` to "Female" and "Male". 

```{r}
# your code here
```
```{r}
# your code here
```
```{r}
# your code here
```


**Problem 2: (4 pts)** 

Now make a pie chart of the dataset you generated in Problem 1. Use `theme_void()` to remove all distracting elements. 

```{r}
# your code here
