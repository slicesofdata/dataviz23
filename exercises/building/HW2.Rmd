**Problem 1: (3 pts)** We will work with the dataset `txhouse` that has been derived from the `txhousing` dataset provided by **ggplot2**. See here for details of the original dataset: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/txhousing.html. `txhouse` contains three columns: `city` (containing four Texas cities), `year` (containing four years between 2000 and 2015) and `total_sales` indicating the total number of sales for the specified year and city.

```{r}
txhouse
```

Use ggplot to make a bar plot of the total housing sales (column `total_sales`) for each `city` and show one panel per `year`. You do not have to worry about the order of the bars. Hint: Use `facet_wrap()`. See slides from Class 2.


```{r}
# your code goes here
```

**Problem 2: (3 pts)** Use ggplot to make a bar plot of the total housing sales (column `total_sales`) for each `year`. Color the bar borders with color `"gray20"` and assign a fill color based on the `city` column. 

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

**Problem 3: (4 pts)** Modify the plot from Problem 2 by placing the bars for each city side-by-side rather than stacked. Next, reorder the bars for each `year` by `total_sales` in descending order. See slides from Class 4.

```{r}
