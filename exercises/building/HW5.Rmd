**This homework is due on Feb. 28, 2023 at 11:00pm. Please submit as a pdf file on Canvas.**

**Problem 1:  (4 pts)** We will work with the `ufo_sightings` dataset. 

Since 2000 (inclusive), what are the top 10 cities that have reported the most UFO sightings? Create a new dataframe to answer the question. No plots are necessary.


```{r}
# your code here
```


**Problem 2: (4 pts)** 

Next, how has the number of UFO sightings changed for five states since 1940? Please follow these steps:

1. Filter the dataset to keep the following five states: AZ, IL, NM, OR, WA
2. Keep only the records from 1940 and onwards. 
3. Find the number of records for each year and state. 
4. Output the new table below your code block.

Your final table should be in long format and have three columns, `year`, `state`, and `count`. You will plot this table in Problem 3.


```{r}
# your code here
```

**Problem 3: (2 pts)** 

Use the new dataframe you made in Problem 2 and add an appropriate color scale from the `colorspace` package to the plot below.

```{r eval = FALSE}
new_df %>% # use the dataframe from Problem 2 here, and set eval = TRUE in the chunk header 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = state)) +
 geom_line() +
 xlab("Year") +
 ylab("UFO Sightings (Count)") +
 theme_bw()
```
