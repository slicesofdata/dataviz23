    "text": "PSYC 167: Data Visualization\nThis is the course website for PSYC 167: Data Visualization, taught by Prof. Gabriel I. Cook; 1 credit\nDescription\nData visualization is the science and art of creating graphical representations of information and data. Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nSources\nThis course will use open-educational resources, typically licensed on creative commons."

If you need help completing this step, please email me.\nThis week we will cover the first chapter of the textbook, which goes into several important details about using Rstudio. In section 1.2, the authors recommend that “now would be a good time to create a notebook where you can keep a record of useful hints and tips and things to try when your code isn’t working.”\nMaking a tip sheet for yourself is the assignment for this weeks blog post.\n\nInstructions\n\nMake a new blog post where you can write “tips” and notes as you are learning about Rstudio this week. Please feel free to make notes during class and stuff this blog post with as many things that will be helpful for you to remember.\nSubmit the URL to your tips post to the week 2 assignment on blackboard."

    "text": "Course Description\nData visualization is the science and art of creating graphical representations of information and data. Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nPrerequisite: For data-science sequence or majors (level-A data-science course); recommended a course in Perception, Visual Attention, Cognitive Psychology, or Cognitive Science; or permission of instructor\n\nCourse Specific Learning Goals\n\nUnderstand various uses of visual variables to create data visualizations;\nUnderstand both advantages and disadvantages of using visual variables to create data visualizations;\nAnalyze, critique, and revise data visualizations;\nUnderstand the functionality of the ggplot2 library for creating data visualizations;\nPresent data with visual representations for your target audience, task, and data;\nIdentify appropriate data visualization techniques given particular requirements imposed by the data and/or audience; and\nApply appropriate design principles in the creation of presentations and visualizations"

    "text": "University’s policy on Academic Integrity\nThe faculty and administration of Claremont McKenna College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both.\n\nViolations of Academic integrity\nEach student is responsible for understanding and acting in accordance with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAlthough you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty, even those raised by concerned peers, will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated. Many students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism so I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course and would be a violation of integrity. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\n\nStatement of Reasonable Accommodations\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability & Accessibility Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me during the first week of the semester so we can discuss your needs in this course ASAP. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Accessibility Services but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at AccessibilityServices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and accommodations request information be found at the CMC DOS Accessibility Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Accessibility Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. I would err on the side of caution and make sure your accommodations are sent to me even if you do not believe you need them as some students only learn they may need time after completing assessment. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act do not make accommodations retroactive. If you are approved for extra testing time for example, you must do so before an electronic assessment is posted in order for it to be integrated into the assessment. Claremont McKenna College values creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability & Accessibility Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.\n\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CMC’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office."
