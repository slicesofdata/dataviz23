    "section": "Data science in a box",
    "text": "Data science in a box\nThere are many great free resources on the web for learning data skills with R. This example comes from data science in a box.\nhttps://datasciencebox.org\nThis whole course is built using quarto, the same tool we will use for our blogs.\nThere are different approaches to learning R from scratch. One approach is start with all of the fundamental building blocks of coding, and then slowly move into much higher level tasks for data analysis, like learning how to use functions for data-visualization. Another approach is to begin with a hands-on example of using R for reproducible data-analysis and visualization.\nNOTE: “Reproducible” is an important concept we will emphasize throughout the course. For now a “reproducible” analysis means that other people can re-do the same analysis that you did and get the same results.\nIn class we will look at the “First dataviz” example from the hello world section:\nhttps://datasciencebox.org/02-hello-world.html\n\nInstructions\nGOAL: Our big goal here is to reproduce the data-visualization from this example on our own computer using R Studio, and then talk about what we are looking at.\n\nOpen Rstudio\nMake a new project\n\n\n\nUnder the file menu, select “New project”, or click the top-right corner of R studio (with the blue R cube), and choose New Project.\nIMPORTANT: You should almost always be working inside an R studio project. We will talk more about this in class.\nChoose “New Directory”\nChoose “New Project”\nCreate a name, and choose where to save it, e.g. “datavis1”\nClick “Create project”\n\n\n\nYou can confirm you are now in an R studio project by looking at the top right hand corner, you should see a blue cube with the name of your project.\n\n\nThis is what an empty R studio project looks like. The bottom right corner shows you the folder for your current project. There is only one file “datavis1.Rproj”. If you click on this file from your filesystem (e.g., in finder on a mac, or in explorer or my computer on windows), then it will load Rstudio and this project.\n\nCreate a new quarto document. Click the green circle with a plus, choose new “Quarto document”.\n\n\nGive your document a title.\n\nClick the “Render” Button. Then save your document in your R project folder.\nIMPORTANT. The title of your document can be different from the name of the file. You should change the file name from “Untitled.qmd” to something more descriptive like “datavis_example.qmd”, and then press save.\nAfter saving and rendering the document you will see the html (web-page) output. The file doesn’t have any text or analysis code, so it will appear mostly blank.\n\nThe datascience in a box course has an example data analysis and visualization that we should be able to reproduce on our computers.\nThis example shows a short data-analysis report that conducts a visualization of United Nations voting data for different countries.\nThe source code for this report is available here:\nhttps://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/main/course-materials/application-exercises/ae-01a-un-votes/unvotes.qmd\n\nCopy the plain text from line 1 to line 92, and then paste it into your own .qmd document. Make sure you replace all of your original text. Save your .qmd document.\nRstudio may ask you to install some missing packages, click the install option.\nOnce the packages are installed, then you should be able to render the document. And, you should see something like this.\n\n\nWe are going to cover the rest in class. If you missed class you can try the videos about this content on datascience in a\nhttps://datasciencebox.org/02-hello-world.html\nThe first two videos are probably most helpful and similar to what we will discuss in class.\nFinally, I created a folder called examples in the gihthub repository for this course. This example is located in the “datavis1” folder. You can also download this folder and access its contents as another method to try the example:\nhttps://github.com/CrumpLab/psyc3470/tree/master/examples"

    "text": "Overview\nThe textbook chapter covers writing R markdown documents (.Rmd extension). R Markdown is a notebook style coding document that can contain plain text (markdown), and executable R code chunks along with outputs, and compile everything into one output document. This system uses a package called knitr to “knit” together the plain text and code into a final output.\nOur class is using a newer notebook system called quarto (.qmd extension). Most of the same concepts and syntax used in r.Rmd work in .qmd.\nWe are just starting to learn bits of R coding. In class we have executed bits of R code in the console. Moving forward we will be writing whole scripts of code and saving our scripts in text files. It is possible to store R code in .R files, however, these script files do not allow for regular text. Instead, we will be using notebook style .qmd documents that contain both code and text.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT: Reproducible document\nThe most important concept here is that we will be learning to code using a reproducible document creation system. This provides an integrated document format to write and execute code, and to write text for purposes of communication.\n\n\nBasic Skills for this section\n\nBe able to make a new .qmd document\nBe able to render a .qmd document\nExplain the difference between the source editor view and visual editor view in Rstudio.\nBe able to insert simple markdown plain text (headers, lists, paragraphs), and render the document.\nBe aware of resources to help you learn more about markdown options.\nBe able to insert an R code chunk, and show the output in the rendered document.\n\n\nmacro for quick insert\n\n\nRunning R code chunks in a qmd\n\n\npressing play\ncopy/paste into console\nhighlight then command-enter (mac)\nprecedence issues (first to last)\n\n\nBe aware of R code chunk options, and how to use eval, messages, error, warning, and echo.\nBe able to set code chunk options per chunk, and/or for the whole document. Understand rules for precedence (which options will apply if both are set.)\nWrite inline r code.\nExplain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.\nBe aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options."

Students can use these very same methods to create their own personal websites, which can be used as a digital portfolio to showcase examples of their work and demonstrate their skills. To support digital portfolio development, students will learn to create a personal website and blog. Students will add content to their websites in the form of blogs and other weekly assignment content prompts. By the end of the course students will have created evidence of their learning process in the form of their course website and blog. Students can choose to share their coursework publicly or privately.\n\n\n\nThis is an engagement and skills-acquisition based course. At the beginning of the course and throughout, students will be given instruction on building and maintaining a website using quarto and github pages. Each week students will contribute blog posts and other content to their websites in response to module assignments. Students will be expected to submit URL links to their blogs using Blackboard. Students are expected to attend and participate in each class.

If you have already established accommodations with Disability & Accessibility Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me during the first week of the semester so we can discuss your needs in this course ASAP. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Accessibility Services but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at AccessibilityServices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and accommodations request information be found at the CMC DOS Accessibility Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Accessibility Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. I would err on the side of caution and make sure your accommodations are sent to me even if you do not believe you need them as some students only learn they may need time after completing assessment. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act do not make accommodations retroactive. If you are approved for extra testing time for example, you must do so before an electronic assessment is posted in order for it to be integrated into the assessment. Claremont McKenna College values creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability & Accessibility Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.\n\n\n\n\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CMC’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\n\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about the syllabus, let’s talk about it in class, and/or please create a thread to discuss the question on the discussion board for this course on Blackboard."

    "text": "Data visualization is the science and art of creating graphical representations of information and data. Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nPrerequisite: For data-science sequence or majors (level-A data-science course); recommended a course in Perception, Visual Attention, Cognitive Psychology, or Cognitive Science; or permission of instructor\n\n\n\nUnderstand various uses of visual variables to create data visualizations;\nUnderstand both advantages and disadvantages of using visual variables to create data visualizations;\nAnalyze, critique, and revise data visualizations;\nUnderstand the functionality of the ggplot2 library for creating data visualizations;\nPresent data with visual representations for your target audience, task, and data;\nIdentify appropriate data visualization techniques given particular requirements imposed by the data and/or audience; and\nApply appropriate design principles in the creation of presentations and visualizations"

GE courses are not intended to be easy. Because they are often not part of one’s major, they can be often be more difficult because the content covered is likely unfamiliar to you."
