    "text": "PSYC 167: Data Visualization\nThis is the course website for PSYC 167: Data Visualization, taught by Prof. Gabriel I. Cook; 1 credit\nDescription\nData visualization is the science and art of creating graphical representations of information and data. Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nSources\nThis course will use open-educational resources, typically licensed on creative commons."

    "text": "Reading Excel Spreadsheets with {readxl}\nWe will use the {readxl} library to handing reading of Excel files. Because Excel files can contain multiple sheets, one goal would be to find out the sheet names using readxl::excel_sheets (see ?readxl::excel_sheets). This function takes one argument, which is the path to the file. Passing the path will return the sheet names in that file. We can pass the path string directly into the function or if the file path is already saved as a object, pass that. In both cases, let’s save it as\nIn order to read an Excel spreadsheet file, you will need to specify at very least file and if you want to read a specific sheet other than the first one, then you will need to specify sheet.\n\nfile: a path to the file,\nsheet: the sheet name to read\n\n\nGetting Sheet Names\n\nreadxl::excel_sheets(path = here::here(\"data\", \"cms-top-all-time-2023-swim.xlsx\"))\n\n[1] \"diving\" \"swim\"   \"relay\" \n\nfile &lt;- here::here(\"data\", \"cms-top-all-time-2023-swim.xlsx\")\n\nreadxl::excel_sheets(path = file)\n\n[1] \"diving\" \"swim\"   \"relay\" \n\n\nGreat, we know know the sheet names. The benefit of passing an object is that you you may wish to pass the path to another function, for example, to read a sheet from the file.\n\n\nReading a Sheet\nIn order to read a sheet, we will use readxl::read_excel(), which takes the file path as the first argument and the name of the desired sheet as the second argument. You might get away with passing only the path as long as your goal is to read the first sheet because this is the default action. Let’s wrap the function in head() to see the top.\n\nhead(\n  readxl::read_excel(file)\n)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  score  name              year  event         \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 525.35 Maia Presti       2015  1-Meter Diving\n2 514.70 Makenna Parkinson 2023  1-Meter Diving\n3 512.05 Emma Ng Pack      2023  1-Meter Diving\n4 494.95 Izzy Doud         2023  1-Meter Diving\n5 462.15 Carli Lessard     2015  1-Meter Diving\n6 447.70 Alexis Romero     2023  1-Meter Diving\n\n\nThe function also turns the file content into a data frame composed of row and column data. Luckily we have a clean file and nothing too messy. You can verify using R’s built-in function is.data.frame(), which will return TRUE if it’s a data frame or FALSE if not. We will assign this to an object\n\nis.data.frame(readxl::read_excel(file))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nBut we don’t want the first sheet. Pass sheet = \"swim\" to read that sheet. Also, let’s read in the data and assign it to an object called DAT which will hold the data frame.\n\nDAT &lt;- readxl::read_excel(file, sheet = \"swim\")\n\nAnother way to read data files is using either {vroom}, which is extremely fast for reading large files (see docs for why it’s so awesome), or using {dplyr} library that is part of the {tidyverse}. {dplyr}, however, does not handle Excel files. In order to demonstrate how to use {readr}, we can save the data frame as a .csv file."

    "text": "Managing file paths with {here}\nDespite it’s name, {readr} can save data frames too. Interestingly, at least at the time of this writing, {readr} allows you to write files in excel format even though you cannot open them.\nMoving forward, you can save the data frame as a .csv file using readr::write_csv(). When writing a file using write_csv() we need to specify key arguments: x, the data frame object and file, the file name. You do not need to set a delimiter because, given its name, .csv defaults the separation as a comma \",\". Other arguments may be necessary for other files and goals.\nIf, however, you specify name of the file (e.g., \"my file name.csv\"), the data frame will be written to a default location because no file path was provided. Um, so where is that default location? Well it depends and it’s complicated depending on whether files are .R or .Rmd. By default, .Rmd files will assume the directory from which the .Rmd file, NOT THE DATA FILE, is opened. But you don’t want to save a data file to the directory where your code lives.\nIf you are organized, you save your .R and .Rmd files in code directory and your data files in a data directory. So yeah, the default is a problem. The solution is to specify the file path using file = the file path.\nWhat’s the best way? The easiest/best way is with the {here} library, assuming of course you are smart enough to be using projects in RStudio. When you open a file from within a project, {here} will make the project directory the working directory. And if you are organized, your data files will be in a /data directory inside the project directory. When passing \"data\" as the first argument to here::here() ( e.g., here::here(\"data\"), you will see that the function returns a string containing the full path to the project directory plus the data subdirectory.\n\nhere::here(\"data\")\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/gcook/Sync/git/dataviz23/data\""

Every time to pass the path and the path changes you will need to change this by hand and doing so could be extremely annoying. For example, if you change the save location or the file name, you’ll need to make updates for all code referencing the path. To avoid potential headaches, we can instead use gsub() to examine a string, look for a pattern, and replace that pattern with another pattern. All we want to do is to change \".xlsx\" or \".xls\" in the string to \".csv\". And because we will next want to use this new name for reading later, let’s assign the change to a new string object, file_csv.\nFirst, let’s see what gsub() is doing.\n\ngsub(pattern = \".xlsx|.xls\",  \n     replacement = \".csv\", \n     x = file\n     )\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/gcook/Sync/git/dataviz23/data/cms-top-all-time-2023-swim.csv\"\n\n\nAssign to an object:\n\nfile_csv &lt;- gsub(\".xlsx|.xls\", \".csv\", file)\n\nSecond, pass the path object to write_csv():\n\nreadr::write_csv(x = DAT, \n                 file = file_csv\n                 )\n\nDid it save?

    "section": "Select Variables Starting with or Ending with Certain Characters",
    "text": "Select Variables Starting with or Ending with Certain Characters\nOne thing about {dplyr}, when you load the library, there are functions from other libraries that are imported along with {dplyr}’s own functions. These important functions are designed to work with each other, so the people who maintain the libraries have packaged them up nicely so you don’t have to load separate libraries.\nMany of the functions are imported from the {tidyselect} library and these functions are what give you additional manipulation ability. Some imported functions are: all_of(), any_of(), contains(), ends_with(), everything(), last_col(), matches(), and starts_with().\nWith functions like starts_with(), contains(), and ends_with(), you can select variables with character patterns in their names.\nRather that passing the names of the variables as the second argument (e.g., c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")), you would pass the helper function, say starts_with(). Whatever starts_with() returns is what gets passed to select() as the variables. This is what is referred to as functional programming. Rather than coding specifically what to do, you with utilize the task of another function to passed its returned object as an argument to another function.\nBut first, we need to see what’s going on with these functions, like starts_with(). For more, use ?starts_with.\nstarts_with(match, ignore.case = TRUE, vars = NULL)\nNotice the arguments we need to pass:\n\nmatch: A character vector\nignore.case: If TRUE, the default, ignores case when matching names. This is most flexible.\nvars: A character vector of variable names. If not supplied, the variables are taken from the current selection context (as established by functions like select() or pivot_longer()).\n\nLet’s just try out starts_with() on its own. Let’s set a required pattern match = some character and because vars = NULL by default, let’s just set vars = some character vector. Note that vars is not the second argument, so you will want to name it in the function call.\n\nstarts_with(match = \"a\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nReturns integer(0) which is speak for “there is no match”. Hmm, OK. Let’s try another character.\n\nstarts_with(match = \"b\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOK, so now an integer is returned (yes, try is.integer() if you don’t believe me).\n\nis.integer(starts_with(\"b\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nImportantly, the value refers to the element index/position in the vars vector. Because the third string \"Bye\" starts with \"b\", that’s what is returned.\nTry something else…\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n\n[1] 1 2\n\n\nNow a vector with length = 2 is returned, representing both the first and the second elements start with “h”.\n\nlength(starts_with(\"h\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")))\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nSee, it’s really a vector containing the element(s) of the vars vector matching the pattern.\nAnd yes, this the letter casing is ignored because the default ignore.case = TRUE. Set to FALSE if you want your match to be case sensitive.\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"), \n            ignore.case = F\n            )\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nOK, no matches.\nYou will typically use starts_with() along with other functions. When using starts_with() in the context of select(), the vars argument is essentially passing vars = the names of the columns of the data frame passed to select().\nExample:\nselect(mydataframe,` \n    starts_with(match = \"my pattern\",\n                vars = \"var names of mydataframe\"))\nWithout piping…\n\nselect(USArrests, starts_with(\"m\")) %&gt;% head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\nWith piping…\n\nUSArrests %&gt;%\n  select(., starts_with(\"m\")) %&gt;% head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\n\nUSArrests %&gt;%\n  select(., ends_with(\"t\")) %&gt;% head()\n\n           Assault\nAlabama        236\nAlaska         263\nArizona        294\nArkansas       190\nCalifornia     276\nColorado       204"

Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nPrerequisite: For data-science sequence or majors (level-A data-science course); recommended a course in Perception, Visual Attention, Cognitive Psychology, or Cognitive Science; or permission of instructor\n\nCourse Specific Learning Goals\n\nUnderstand various uses of visual variables to create data visualizations;\nUnderstand both advantages and disadvantages of using visual variables to create data visualizations;\nAnalyze, critique, and revise data visualizations;\nUnderstand the functionality of the ggplot2 library for creating data visualizations;\nPresent data with visual representations for your target audience, task, and data;\nIdentify appropriate data visualization techniques given particular requirements imposed by the data and/or audience; and\nApply appropriate design principles in the creation of presentations and visualizations"

    "section": "University’s policy on Academic Integrity",
    "text": "University’s policy on Academic Integrity\nThe faculty and administration of Claremont McKenna College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both.\n\nViolations of Academic integrity\nEach student is responsible for understanding and acting in accordance with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAlthough you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty, even those raised by concerned peers, will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated. Many students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism so I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course and would be a violation of integrity. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\n\nStatement of Reasonable Accommodations\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability & Accessibility Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me during the first week of the semester so we can discuss your needs in this course ASAP. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Accessibility Services but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at AccessibilityServices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and accommodations request information be found at the CMC DOS Accessibility Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Accessibility Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. I would err on the side of caution and make sure your accommodations are sent to me even if you do not believe you need them as some students only learn they may need time after completing assessment. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act do not make accommodations retroactive. If you are approved for extra testing time for example, you must do so before an electronic assessment is posted in order for it to be integrated into the assessment. Claremont McKenna College values creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability & Accessibility Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.\n\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CMC’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office."
