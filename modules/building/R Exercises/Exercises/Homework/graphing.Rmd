```{r}
health < read.csv("c:/users/gcook/desktop/Psyc109/cdc.csv")
str(health)

library("lattice")

xyplot(age ~ weight, 
       data = health,
       type = "l")

graph1 <- xyplot(weight ~ age | gender, 
                 data = health,
                 type = c("p", "r"))

graph2 <- xyplot(height ~ age | gender, 
                 data = health,
                 type = c("p", "r"))

#arrange plots in a grid for a single plot
library("gridExtra")
grid.arrange(graph1, graph2, ncol = 2)
