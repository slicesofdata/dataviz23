Type your R code between the back ticks (e.g., ```). Once completed with your assignment, click the **Knit** button on the toolbar to create your HTML document of both your R code chunks and the R output.

```{r} 
Sys.time()
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
